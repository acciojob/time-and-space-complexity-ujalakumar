	<h1>Time,Space comolexity</h1>
	<p>A lot of students get confused while understanding the concept of time complexity, but in this article, we will explain it with a very simple example.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, </p>

    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, efficient, Time complexity is number of lines that are executed in order to complete the task.And this on the basis of efficient.</p>
	<P>Space Complexity, O(n) Space complexity is related to the amount of memory occupied by a program. if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space complexity of the program becomes O(n).</P>
	<P><b>Space Complexity</b> is related to the amount of memory occupied by a program.In simple terms, any program’s space complexity is calculated by the total amount of space it occupies in the computer’s memory.</P>
