    <h1>Time,Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is number of lines that are executed in order to complete the task.And this on the basis of efficient.</p>
	<P>Space complexity is related to the amount of memory occupied by a program. if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space complexity of the program becomes O(n).</P>
	<P><b>Space omplexity</b> is related to the amount of memory occupied by a program.In simple terms, any program’s space complexity is calculated by the total amount of space it occupies in the computer’s memory.</P>
